# LangNotes

This is a full-stack application developed as a tool for students in foreign languages. The app allows the user to store vocabularies and lessons'notes as an integration to an external study class.

The app is developed in (React Framework) [https://reactjs.org/] as a project to display my skills in PERN app development.
